# JetPackCompose Basic to Intermediate

# Introduction
This repository useful to learn basic to intermediate level of Jetpack compose. Jetpack compose(JC) is a modern ui development toolkit.
It serves as a beginner-friendly project, providing an introduction to Jetpack Compose for newcomers and go up to Intermediate level.

UI : You will learn how Compose basic UI element works. Like how to add image, text, list, how to scroll layout, about theming, animations and colors, etc.

State : You will learn how state management of UI element works in compose. learn about state handling 
        when configuration change, during recomposition and how to use state variable for state-hoisting to re-use 
        Stateless compose element.

# Topics
- What is Jetpack compose?:

   Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. Jetpack Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

- Composable functions:

    Jetpack Compose is built around composable functions. These functions let you define your app's UI programmatically by describing how it should look and providing data dependencies, rather than focusing on the process of the UI's construction (initializing an element, attaching it to a parent, etc.). To create a composable function, just add the @Composable annotation to the function name.
More info ðŸ‘‰ https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial#lesson-1:-composable-functions

- Layouts:

    UI elements are hierarchical, with elements contained in other elements. In Compose, you build a UI hierarchy by calling composable functions from other composable functions.

- Lists and animations:

    Lists and animations are everywhere in apps. In this lesson, you will learn how Compose makes it easy to create lists and fun to add animations.

- Navigation:

     The Navigation component provides support for Jetpack Compose applications. You can navigate between composable while taking advantage of the Navigation componentâ€™s infrastructure and features.

# Branches Info:
#1_composable_function_info : 
How composable function works is show in this branch code and how recomposition works in jetpack compose.

#3_add_rows_and_columns: 
Add Row and column to create complex layout in compose.

#4_state_of_composable: 
State of composable is good topic to learn in detail because of it you will find difficulty in recomposition.

#5_add_lazy_list_aka_recyclerview:
Lazy row and lazy column is like horizontal and vertical recyclerview but easy way to implement scrolling behaviour in compose. 

#6_add_animation_and_theme:
Add animation when composable element state changes.

#7_add_card_composable:
Add Card composable or custom composable to make UI better.

#bottom_viewpager: 
It is a viewpager in Jetpack compose.

#tab-layout: 
Tab layout in Jetpack compose.

#Constraint-layout:
Use Constaint layout to make Indian flag.
